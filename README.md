### Introduction
This repository contains several Arduino libraries I have written to be used in applications such as smart robot-car and IoT devices. I will continuously add example code on how to use the libraries.

### Libraries
[BunnyTimer](libraries/BunnyTimer): A simple and light-weight non-blocking timer library for calling functions in / every specified units of time.

[BunnyLED](libraries/BunnyLED): A simple and light-weight non-blocking library for control the blinking of the LED.
